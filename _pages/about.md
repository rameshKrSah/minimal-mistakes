Hi, I am a graduate student at Washington State University where I study Computer Science. I work in projects related 
to embedded systems, machine learning, and ubiquitous computing. You can find detailed information about me on 
LinkedIn. 

This is my blog, where I write about things I find useful and need a reference to it in future. I don't have a public 
comment section, so if you have any comments please send me a message on Twitter. 

I hope you will find some thing useful here. :)

## Cheers !!
