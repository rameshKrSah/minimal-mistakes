Hi, I am a PhD student at [Embedded and Pervasive System Lab](http://epsl.eecs.wsu.edu/), part of the [School of 
Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://school.eecs.wsu.edu/) at [Washington State University](https://wsu.edu/), 
where I work on Adversarial Machine Learning and Ubiquitous Computing.

From 2016 to 2018, I worked at [Real Time Solutions Pvt. Ltd](https://rts.com.np/), as part of the research and
development team as a Firmware Design Engineer. I primarily designed and wrote firmwares for various products
like remote communication modules, smoke detector, queue management systems etc.
