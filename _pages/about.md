<p style="text-align:justify">
I am interested in the practical applications of machine learning and AI in areas such as health care, public health and wellness, environment, and education. I am also interested in the design, development, and applications of embedded systems in conjunction with machine learning algorithms towards solving minor and major problems in the aforementioned fields. I also like to explore robust machine learning and privacy-preserving machine learning.

Some of my skills are:
<ul>
<li> Python, C++, C and Java</li>
<li> Comprehensive knowledge of deep learning frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Keras</li>
<li> Familiar with JavaScript, HTML, Java, and SQL</li>
<li> Sound knowledge of embedded systems from hardware and software perspectives</li>
</ul>
