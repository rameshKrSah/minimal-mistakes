# Introduction
For the machine learning class that I am taking in Fall 2019, I have been doing a lot of excellent homeworks. The homeworks
are usually long and requires a lot of time and effort. One way to document what I have done and also learn more about
the topics I had worked on is to turn these homeworks into blog posts. This blog post is on the Perceptron and
Passive-Aggressive algorithm, from homework 1. I will try to include as much background as I can and explain the code in 
details. Let's begin.

# Perceptron Algorithm
I think there is no better book than the "*A Course in Machine Learning*" by Hal Daume that explains the theoritical and
mathematical rigor behind the Perceptron and the Passive-Aggressive algorthims. I strongly encourage the reader to
consult the chapter on Perceptron from the book. The book is available freely online. Most of the theory I am going to
include here will be from the same book.
