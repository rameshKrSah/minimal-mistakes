This article is a brief summary of our paper on "[Adversarial Transferability in 
Wearable Sensor Systems]"(https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.07982.pdf). In this work we 
have explored the topic of adversarial transferability from prespectives, that 
we believe are novel and are not discussed yet. But before we discuss our results 
and findings, let's first understand few topics and the framework of the paper.
