# Introduction
This article is a brief summary of our paper on "[Adversarial Transferability in 
Wearable Sensor Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.07982.pdf)". In this work we 
have explored the topic of adversarial transferability from prespectives, that 
we believe are novel and are not discussed yet. But before we discuss our results 
and findings, let's first understand few topics and the framework of the paper.

# Adversarial Transferability
For the uninitiated, adversarial transferability captures the ability of adversarial 
examples that makes them transfer between independently trained models of different 
architectures. In almost all works on adversarial transferability, 
the discussion is usually carried out from the perspective of models. We believe 
in understanding adversarial transferability fully, and in uncovering the reasons 
behind their existence in the first place, we need to consider other avenues such 
as the datasets that are used to train the machine learning models. To this end 
in our work. We have tried to explore adversarial transferability and give a 
comprehensive discussion that takes into account the model and the dataset with 
wearable sensor systems as a case study.
